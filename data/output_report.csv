ludong@buffalo.edu,1100021003.mp4,1100021003.mp4,"The report generated for this video is as follows:

- The facial action analysis shows:

    • AU1 (Inner Brow Raiser) – 14.75%, associated with attentiveness or mild surprise.
    • AU12 (Lip Corner Puller) – 98.36%, indicates sustained smiling and positive affect.
    • AU15 (Chin Raiser) – 98.36%, may reflect emotional control or mild sadness.
    • AU22 (Lips Part) – 1.64%, rare lip movements suggest limited verbal expression.
    • AU40 (Left Dimpler) – 62.30%, possibly indicates subtle, asymmetrical smiling.

- Valence fluctuates across the clip, while Arousal remains consistently high. The combination of negative valence and high arousal in the mid-segment suggests moments of stress or cognitive effort. Later segments show positive valence with high arousal, indicating emotionally engaged and energetic states.

- No eye blinks were detected, suggesting sustained visual attention.

- Eye tracking confirms focused gaze on learning content (~80%) with minimal deviation, though brief jump glances during quiz sections may reflect temporary uncertainty.

Overall, the student shows high engagement throughout the video, with no strong signs of boredom or frustration."

- The facial action analysis shows:

    • AU3 (Brow Lowerer) – Active in 72.13% of frames. This AU involves the contraction of the muscles between the eyebrows, often associated with concentration, negative affect, or emotional tension. Its sustained presence may reflect cognitive effort or mild frustration.

    • AU5 (Upper Lid Raiser / Cheek Raiser) – Active in 3.28% of frames. This AU is typically linked to surprise, alertness, or interest, but the low activation rate suggests only occasional moments of increased attention or emotional arousal.

    • AU22 (Lips Part) – Active in 1.64% of frames. This AU is associated with verbal expression or mild emotional reaction. Its rare occurrence in this video may indicate limited speech or passive engagement.

- Valence fluctuates across the clip, while Arousal remains consistently high. The combination of negative valence and high arousal in the mid-segment suggests moments of stress or cognitive effort. Later segments show positive valence with high arousal, indicating emotionally engaged and energetic states.

- Three eye blinks were observed. The low frequency and brief duration suggest focused attention and cognitive engagement, as learners often suppress blinking to maintain visual continuity and concentration.

- Eye tracking confirms focused gaze on learning content (~80%) with minimal deviation, though brief jump glances during quiz sections may reflect temporary uncertainty.
